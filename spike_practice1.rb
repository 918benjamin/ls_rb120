GameEngine
  - attribute - team 1
  - attribute - team 2
  - attribute - referee
  - behavior - play game

Team Class
  - attribute - players (array)

Participant Class
  behavior - run
  attribute - shirt_color
  
  2 types
  
  - player class (Participant subclass)
    behavior - shoot
    
    3 players (each are player sublcass)
      - midfielder - pass
      - attacker - lobs
